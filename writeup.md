# Assignment 10

## Sepuri and Vaslow

I learmed how to track analytics through Swift for an iOS app. I also learned how visualize tracked analytics through different charts with Mixpanel. I was surprised by how little code was required to get the analytics working. However, there was a significant delay before I could see the updates reflected on the dashboard.

Something I learned during this assignment was how to use Mixpanel for Analytics. Mixpanel was easy and straight forward to use, and we were able to add analytics to our project with only a few lines of code. Something that was frustrating was that the dashboards updated pretty infrequently so making sure our implementation worked wasn't super easy. However, this assignment was still on the shorter and easier side of all the assignments.
