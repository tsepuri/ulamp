# Assignment 6

## Prusky and Sepuri

## Jake Prusky 

I learned how templating in django works to reduce the amount of HTML code you need to write for a simple project. I also learned how to manage the backend of a simple website to set up user authentication and modify the views and privileges based on the user.

## Tarun Sepuri

I learned how to set up a Django website and connect it to different urls and different views. I also learned how to connect a Django website to a database and make migrations through models in Python. I was surprised at how easy the admin page in Django was to access and modify data and privileges.
