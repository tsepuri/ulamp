# Assignment 8

## Sepuri and Vaslow

## Tarun Sepuri

I learned in this assignment was how to create a basic iOS app using XCode. I also learned the basics of Swift. I was surprised about how easy it was to see how the app would run on different Apple devices from XCode itself.

## Alex Vaslow

Something I learned this assignment was how to use Swift, SwiftUI and XCode. This assignment was interesting and straightforward, and it was cool to see our app run on a phone with minimal setup. The only drawback of this assignment is that you code only code on a Mac, so we could not work on it separately at all. We probably spend under 3 hours on the assignment, the least of any of the assignments.
