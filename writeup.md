# Assignment 9

## Seouri and Vaslow

## Tarun Sepuri

Something I learned during this assignment was how to use CoreBluetooth to connect to peripheral devices on an iOS app. I also learned how to pack the data sent through BTLE and ensure that the data was consistent on both ends. I was suprised at how much code was required to get it working, as a lot of it seemed slightly repetitive.

## Alex Vaslow

Something I learned during this assignment was how to use BLE using bleno and node.js. The suggestion of dividing this assignment into 2 parts was very helpful, because we could easily tell where issues were coming from. The repetitiveness and complexity of the bleno code was a little frustrating, but since we were mostly just replicating the same pattern it wasn't that bad. It was very cool to be able to control the lampi from my phone. We probably spent 5-7 hours on this assignment.
