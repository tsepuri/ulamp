# Remote Updates

Depending on the system, there are lots of different remote update techniques available.  We will be using one consistent with our system - since Raspbian is a Debian based Linux distribution, we will use the Debian package infrastructure.

You have been using Debian's system (and Ubuntu's, which is built on Debian) all semester, with the `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get install PACKAGE_NAME` to update your local package database and install a particular package, respectively.

There are two separate things going on here:

1. managing the package database (querying source repositories for their package index information) 
1. downloading and installing those packages

The packages we are referring to are [Debian packages](https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging#What_is_a_.22package.22.3F).  A Debian Package is an archive file with a specific format.  The archive contents for a package include:

* metadata about the package contents, versions, etc.
* scripts to be run before installing, after installing, before removing, after removing, etc.
* the actual files (binary executables, libraries, /etc configuration files, etc.)

Debian packages that are manged by the Debian repositories are typically built from source code.

This chapter will focus on creating a [debian package](https://wiki.debian.org/RepositoryFormat) for our LAMPI software and automating the update process.  First, though, we need to create a package repository to host our packages. 

# Creating an Apt Repository

We ae going to create a Debian package repository using [reprepro](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/SetupWithReprepro). `reprepro` is a tool to create and manage a local repository of Debian packages.  We will host our Debian repository on the same EC2 instance as our Django server and route it through NGINX, which is already up and running to serve our Django app.  The Debian repository as served by NGINX is a set of directories and files - static content.

### Creating Keys

Reprepro uses [GPG](https://www.gnupg.org) keys for security (e.g., code signing), so we'll start by making keys. GPG uses [system entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28computing%29#Linux_kernel) to generate secure keys. Unfortunately we won't have enough entropy on our EC2 server -- there's no mouse and keyboard data and not nearly enough disk activity to fill the pool (here is a good [introduction to Linux's entropy pool](https://hackaday.com/2017/11/02/what-is-entropy-and-how-do-i-get-more-of-it/)). 

So, as a workaround, we're going to use [rng-tools](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/user/tlecarrour/rng-tools.html) to generate entropy. Note that **this is a poor workaround** and will not produce cryptographically secure keys. In a production system we should generate entropy using a [hardware RNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator) or by generating the keys on a local machine with keyboard and mouse activity and transferring them to our server.

```bash
cloud$ sudo apt-get install rng-tools
cloud$ sudo rngd -r /dev/urandom
```

Now we're going to configure options for how GPG keys are generated. 

We need to make our **~/.gnupg** directory and limit permissions:

```bash
cloud$ mkdir -p ~/.gnupg
cloud$ chmod og-rwx ~/.gnupg
```

Edit **~/.gnupg/gpg.conf** so that it contains the following:

```
personal-digest-preferences SHA256
cert-digest-algo SHA256
default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
```

Finally, generate the keys:

```bash
cloud$  gpg --full-generate-key
```

It will ask you several questions. Answer:

* Kind of key: (1) RSA and RSA
* Length: 4096
* Expiry: 0 (key does not expire, confirm)
* Enter name and email, NO COMMENT
* Enter a passphrase and confirm. You'll need to enter this passphrase when you submit a new package to the repo.

Now go ahead and list your keys:

```bash
cloud$ gpg --list-keys --keyid-format=short
```

You should get some sort of output like this:

```
-------------------------------
pub   rsa4096/3E759EB7 2019-03-25 [SCEA]
      7C7B2DBF7C7A5C688C6ED12ED367304D3E759EB7
uid         [ultimate] fname lname <you@something.com>
sub   rsa4096/8F78BAB9 2019-03-25 [SEA]
```

Write down the value for the subkey (after "sub"), specifically the value after the **rsa4096/**. In the example above, it would be **8F78BAB9**. You'll need this in a moment.

Publish the key to keyserver.ubuntu.com so we can access it later on our lamp. Replace {{SUB_KEY}} with the key value you just noted (8F78BAB9, in the example above).

```bash
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-key {{SUB_KEY}}
```

### Create repository

Install reprepro:

```bash
cloud$ sudo apt-get install -y reprepro
```

Create a directory structure for your Debian repo, then ensure your user is the owner of the directory structure:

```bash
cloud$ sudo mkdir -p ~/connected-devices/Web/reprepro/ubuntu/{conf,dists,incoming,indices,logs,pool,project,tmp}
cloud$ cd ~/connected-devices/Web/reprepro/ubuntu/
cloud$ sudo chown -R `whoami` .
```

Now edit **~/connected-devices/Web/reprepro/ubuntu/conf/distributions** in your editor of choice. Replace the following values:

* {{FULL_NAME}} - Your full name (e.g., Jane Doe)
* {{REPO_NAME}} - Repo full name (e.g., Jane's Debian Repo)
* {{REPO_SHORT_NAME}} - Single lower case word used to refer to repository (e.g., jane)
* {{SUB_KEY}} - Key you wrote down in earlier (e.g., 8F78BAB9)

```
Origin: {{FULL_NAME}}
Label: {{REPO_NAME}}
Codename: {{REPO_SHORT_NAME}}
Architectures: armhf armel
Suite: stable
Components: main non-free contrib
Description: Local Debian repository
SignWith: {{SUB_KEY}}
```

That should be enough to run your package server, although it's not exposed to the internet yet.
