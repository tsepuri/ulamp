# iOS New Project

Now we are going to build a simple app and deploy it to our iOS device. The assignment will require running on real hardware, so as you run through this make sure you can deploy to a iPhone and not just the iPhone Simulator.

### Start a New Project

From the welcome page of Xcode, click **Create a new Xcode project** (or in the menu, **File** > **New** > **Project...**).

Under **iOS** > **Application**, select **App** and click **Next**.

In the next dialog, set:

* **Project Name** to **Lampi**
* **Team** to your name
* **Organization Identifier** to something like **com.[your_name]**
* **Interface** to **SwiftUI** 
* **Life Cycle** to **SwiftUI App**
* **Language** to **Swift** 
* **deselect Use Core Data**
* **deselect Include Tests** (unless you want to use tests, they are not part of this exercise)

**This Courseware is for Swift and SwiftUI. If you are more familiar with Objective C or the other iOS UI technologies and prefer to use it, that is fine, but you are on your own.**

Click **Next**. You will be asked where you want your project to be created. Choose a directory and click **Create** (deselect "Create Git Repository on my Mac").

### Build and Run

Now is a good time to verify that we can run our project on a real phone - the app does not do anything at this point - it will only get more complicated from here. 

Plug in your iPhone to your Mac and unlock your phone if it is protected with a passcode. Up in the Xcode toolbar you should see your **build target** and **device**:

The current device is an iPhone Simulator. Click on it, and under the **iOS Devices** section, choose the iPhone you just plugged in:

Click the **Build and run** (play) button (or press ⌘ + R).

You may be asked to enabled **Developer Mode** on the Mac. Click **Enable** and enter your OS password.

If this is your first time connecting your phone to Xcode, you may need to wait a while for "Processing Symbol Files".

If you get any prompts about Xcode failing to build and/or run and there is a button that says **Fix Issue** -  clicking this button should allow you proceed.

Finally, the very first build will probably fail with a not-at-all-vague, easy-to-troubleshoot error like this:

To resolve this, go to your iPhone **Settings** > **General** > **Device Management**. You should see an entry with your Apple ID in there. Tap on it and tap **Trust "[apple_id]"**, then tap **Trust**. 

If you are not on the latest version of iOS, try finding the installed app on your phone, tapping it, and tapping **Trust** when prompted.

Go back to Xcode and click **Build and run** again. It should deploy and launch an app with **just a big white screen with "Hello, world!"** on your phone.

Congratulations! You have successfully built and deployed an app to an iOS device (the app does not do anything, yet, but we will work on that now).
